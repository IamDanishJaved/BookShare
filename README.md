# BookShare
A mobile application for those students who want to help others by donating books that are not in their use also for those students who cannot afford expensive books or might not be available in the market. There are many students studying in a field where a lot of books in hard copy they have to purchase. Affording/ buying many books is not feasible for those whose parents are not eligible to bear the cost. The purpose of application is to facilitate students to spread knowledge for the betterment of our country.

# Medium-Fi Prototype
In the folder of “BookShare” there is a file attached containing the link to the medium-fi prototype. Just open the link and start using the application. The design and interface has been made so simple so that every student can use it easily by considering the fact of saving time of students. There are some limitations in the medium-fi prototype described below:
-	Input fields don’t ask to enter information for simplicity
-	Not every visible action item is working. By clicking anywhere in the screen, it shows the guide to the action
-	Flow of application is perfectly fine but still there are some restricted lines
-	Since no database is present yet, so actual data is not included in the prototype, just samples are given
# Prototype Evaluation
Evaluation of medium-fi prototype has been done from five different users, definitely students, issues and suggestions are detailed discussed in “Heuristic Evaluation” file added in the repository.
